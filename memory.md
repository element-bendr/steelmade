- Created backup of original component
- Updated all imports and references
- Added proper TypeScript types
- Improved component documentation

## SEO Optimization (2025-04-29)
- Implemented metadata improvements:
  - OpenGraph tags
  - Twitter cards
  - Canonical URLs
  - Proper alt text

- Created dynamic sitemap generation
- Configured robots.txt
- Added lastModified tracking
- Updated type definitions to support metadata

## Current Focus
- SEO monitoring and analytics setup
- Performance metrics tracking
- Content freshness tracking

## Technical Decisions

### Split Component Architecture
- Reason: Better separation of server/client concerns
- Benefits: 
  - Improved SEO
  - Better performance
  - Cleaner code organization

### Metadata Strategy
- Using Next.js 13 metadata API
- Dynamic generation based on product data
- Standardized structure across all product types

### SEO Implementation
- Chose article type for OpenGraph (product type not supported)
- Implemented lastModified tracking for content freshness
- Prioritized sitemap based on content importance

## Future Considerations
1. Monitor and adjust SEO performance
2. Implement content update tracking
3. Add automated SEO testing
4. Set up monitoring dashboards

## Issues Encountered
1. OpenGraph product type not supported in Next.js metadata
   - Solution: Used article type with product schema in JSON-LD
2. Type definition updates needed for metadata
   - Solution: Updated SeriesMetadata to include new fields

## Next Priorities
1. Set up Google Search Console
2. Implement analytics tracking
3. Create monitoring dashboard
4. Set up automated SEO testing
